**WARNING: UNMAINTAINED SCRIPT AHEAD.**

Script for defragmentation of old filesystems (ext2/3, reiserfs, ...).

This is an old and no-more useful script to defragment old filesystems, which lack anti-fragmentation features or that don't have a defragmentation tool.
Most notably, ext2/ext3 and reiserfs.

**This is NOT maintained anymore. Last modifications were done in 2008 IIRC.**

This script is here just for *reference* and to serve as an *example* for bash coding. It also depends on [davl-tools](http://davtools.sourceforge.net/), that were already becoming obsolete as of the script's writing.
